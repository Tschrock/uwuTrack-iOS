#  uwuTrack iOS
My attempt at making an iOS app for owoTrack ([Discord](https://discord.gg/ttDkJqKDXX), [Github]())

## WIP
This is a work in progress and has a number of issues and rough edges. It works, but only barely.


## Known  Issues
iOS does not provide a way to run a background/foreground service, which means as soon as you lock your phone or switch apps iOS will kill the connection. You'll have to set your phone to always stay awake and leave it unlocked while you use it. There's not much I can do about that. The best workaround is not using an iPhone.

## Installation
 - Download the latest prerelease (uwuTrackVRSync.ipa) from [the GitHub releases](https://github.com/Tschrock/uwuTrack-iOS/releases/latest).
 - Do whatever it is you do to sideload apps. Something like [AltStore](https://altstore.io) looks like it will work but I haven't tried it.
